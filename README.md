GOAL:
Your goal is to eliminate the opponentâ€™s pieces.

Rules:
You can move 1 tile forward for each piece. For red, you are moving down, while for black you are moving up.

If there is a piece of an opposing color in the direction you are hopping to, to the left, or to the right of you with an empty square right after that piece, in a straight line you can take it. Taking it will eliminate that piece and put your piece in that empty square right before the opposing piece was taken.

Taking a piece will grant you an extra turn. If a piece can be captured, it must be captured.

A capital letter piece indicates that they have kinged. These kinged pieces can move any direction, whereas unkinged pieces cannot move backwards.

Type the Y coordinate of the piece and then the X coordinate of the piece you plan to move and then again the Y and X coordinate of the place you want the piece to move. Please make a Valid move too.
When capturing a piece type the Y and X coordinate of the empty square you want to move to that is in the same line as the opposing piece.

Good Luck!
